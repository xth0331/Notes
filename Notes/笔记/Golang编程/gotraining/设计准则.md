# 设计准则

必须制定一种设计原则，以建立一套准则。这比盲目制定一套规则或模式更为重要。准则有助于制定，推动和验证决策。如果不了解决策的影响，就无法开始做出最佳决策。做出的每个决定，编写的每一行代码都需要权衡取舍。



## 哲学

### 准备你的想法

- 包含大量代码的程序给我们留下了深刻的印象。
- 我们努力在代码库创建大型抽象。
- 我们忘记了硬件是平台。
- 我们失去了每个决定都需要付出代价的认识。

**这些日子过去了**

- 我们可以在这个问题上投入更多的硬件。
- 我们可以让更多的开发者来解决这个问题。

**打开你的思维**

- 技术日新月异，但人们的思维却变得缓慢。
- 易于采用新技术，但难以采用新的思维方式。

**有趣的问题-它们意味着什么？**

- 这是一个好程序吗？
- 这是一个有效的程序吗？
- 这是对的吗？
- 它按时完成了吗？
- 费用是多少？

**向往**

- 成为质量，效率和简单性的冠军。
- 有一个观点。
- 价值内省和自我审查。

### 阅读代码

> *“If most computer people lack understanding and knowledge, then what they will select will also be lacking.” - Alan Kay*
>
> *"The software business is one of the few places we teach people to write before we teach them to read." - Tom Love (inventor of Objective C)*
>
> *"Code is read many more times than it is written." - Dave Cheney*
>
> *"Programming is, among other things, a kind of writing. One way to learn writing is to write, but in all other forms of writing, one also reads. We read examples both good and bad to facilitate learning. But how many programmers learn to write programs by reading programs?" - Gerald M. Weinberg*
>
> *"Skill develops when we produce, not consume." - Katrina Owen*

### 旧软件

> *"There are two kinds of software projects: those that fail, and those that turn into legacy horrors." - Peter Weinberger (inventor of AWK)*
>
> *"Legacy software is an unappreciated but serious problem. Legacy code may be the downfall of our civilization." - Chuck Moore (inventor of Forth)*
>
> *"Few programmers of any experience would contradict the assertion that most programs are modified in their lifetime. Why then do we rarely find a program that contains any evidence of having been written with an eye to subsequent modification. - Gerald M. Weinberg"*
>
> *"We think awful code is written by awful devs. But in reality, it's written by reasonable devs in awful circumstances." - Sarah Mei*
>
> *"There are many reasons why programs are built the way they are, although we may fail to recognize the multiplicity of reasons because we usually look at code from the outside rather than by reading it. When we do read code, we find that some of it gets written because of machine limitations, some because of language limitations, some because of programmer limitations, some because of historical accidents, and some because of specifications—both essential and inessential. - Gerald M. Weinberg"*



### 思维模型

必须不断的确保项目思维模型清晰。当不记得某个逻辑在哪里或不记得某事如何工作时，将失去代码的思维模式。这清楚地表明了重构是必须的。将时间集中在提供更可能的最佳思维模型的结构化代码上，并为此进行代码审查。

那个盒子里有多少代码，你认为你可以在脑子里维持一个心智模型？ 我相信，要求一个开发人员在那个盒子里维护一个超过一令纸的心智模型(大约10k 行代码)要求很高。 如果您计算一下，那么需要一个100人的团队来处理一个代码库，这个代码库包含100万行代码。 也就是说，有100个人需要被协调、分组、跟踪，并处于一个持续不断的沟通反馈循环中。

> *"Let's imagine a project that's going to end up with a million lines of code or more. The probability of those projects being successful in the United States these days is very low - well under 50%. That's debatable." - Tom Love (inventor of Objective C)*
>
> *"100k lines of code fit inside a box of paper." - Tom Love (inventor of Objective C)*
>
> *"One of our many problems with thinking is “cognitive load”: the number of things we can pay attention to at once. The cliche is 7±2, but for many things it is even less. We make progress by making those few things be more powerful." - Alan Kay*
>
> *"The hardest bugs are those where your mental model of the situation is just wrong, so you can't see the problem at all." - Brian Kernighan*
>
> *"Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?" - Brian Kernighan*
>
> *"Debuggers don't remove bugs. They only show them in slow motion." - Unknown*
>
> *"Fixing bugs is just a side effect. Debuggers are for exploration." - @Deech (Twitter)*

### 生产力和性能

生产力和性能都很重要，但是在过去，您不可能同时兼顾。您需要选择一个。我们自然而然地倾向于生产力，其想法或希望是硬件可以免费解决我们的性能问题。生产率的提高导致编程语言的设计产生了性能低下的软件，其速度超过了硬件使其更快的能力。

通过遵循Go的习惯用法和一些准则，我们可以编写任何看过它的人都可以推理的代码。我们可以编写简化，减少和减少解决我们正在解决的问题所需的代码量的软件。我们不必再选择生产力而不是性能，也不必再选择性能而不是生产力。我们可以同时拥有。

> *"The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness. Other observers had noted this for some time before, indeed the trend was becoming obvious as early as 1987." - Niklaus Wirth*
>
> *"The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry." - Henry Petroski (2015)*
>
> *"The hardware folks will not put more cores into their hardware if the software isn’t going to use them, so, it is this balancing act of each other staring at each other, and we are hoping that Go is going to break through on the software side.” - Rick Hudson (2015)*
>
> *"C is the best balance I've ever seen between power and expressiveness. You can do almost anything you want to do by programming fairly straightforwardly and you will have a very good mental model of what's going to happen on the machine; you can predict reasonably well how quickly it's going to run, you understand what's going on .... - Brian Kernighan (2000)*
>
> *"The trend in programming language design has been to create languages that enhance software reliability and programmer productivity. What we should do is develop languages alongside sound software engineering practices so the task of developing reliable programs is distributed throughout the software lifecycle, especially into the early phases of system design." - Al Aho (2009)*

### 正确与性能

您希望编写能够优化正确性的代码。 不要根据你认为可能执行得更好的内容来做编码决定。 您必须通过基准测试或配置文件来了解代码是否不够快。 然后，只有这样，你才应该优化性能。 除非你能找到有效的方法，否则这是不可能完成的。

改进来自于编写代码和思考你编写的代码。 然后重构代码使其更好。 这需要其他人的帮助来阅读你正在编写的代码。 首先验证想法的原型。 尝试不同的方法或者要求其他人尝试一个解决方案。 然后比较你所学到的东西。

太多的开发人员在编写产品代码之前没有首先开发他们的想法。 只有通过原型设计，你才能验证你的想法、想法和设计。 在这个时候，你可以打破隔阂，弄清楚事情是如何运作的。 原型在具体和考虑合同后，你有一个工作原型。

重构必须成为开发周期的一部分。 重构是从你每天学到的东西中改进代码的过程。 如果没有时间进行重构，随着时间的推移，代码将变得无法管理和维护。 这就产生了我们今天看到的遗留问题。

> *"The correctness of the implementation is the most important concern, but there is no royal road to correctness. It involves diverse tasks such as thinking of invariants, testing and code reviews. Optimization should be done, but not prematurely." - Al Aho (inventor of AWK)*

> *"The basic ideas of good style, which are fundamental to write clearly and simply, are just as important now as they were 35 years ago. Simple, straightforward code is just plain easier to work with and less likely to have problems. As programs get bigger and more complicated, it's even more important to have clean, simple code." - Brian Kernighan*

> *"Problems can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions. That means there's no glamorous work. You don't get to show off your amazing skills. You just build something that gets the job done and then move on. This approach may not earn you oohs and aahs, but it lets you get on with it." - Jason Fried*
