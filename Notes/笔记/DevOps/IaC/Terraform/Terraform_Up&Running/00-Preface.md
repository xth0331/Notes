> A long time ago, in a datacenter far, far away, an ancient group of powerfulbeings known as “sysadmins” used to deploy infrastructure manually. Everyserver, every database, every load balancer, and every bit of networkconfiguration was created and managed by hand. It was a dark and fearfulage: fear of downtime, fear of accidental misconfiguration, fear of slow andfragile deployments, and fear of what would happen if the sysadmins fell tothe dark side (i.e., took a vacation). The good news is that thanks to theDevOps movement, there is now a better way to do things: Terraform.
